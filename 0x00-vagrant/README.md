# ALX Project 0x01. Git
In this project I learned how to use git how to add git repo how to commit how to push to the remote origin and so on

## How to setup Git in your computer
1. Install git to your computer if not already installed
	* ```bash sudo apt-get update ```
	* ```bash sudo apt-get upgrade```
	* ```bash sudo apt-get install git ```
2. Setting up git after installation
	* ```bash git config --global user.name "Your user name" ```
	* ```bash git config --global user.email "Your email address" ```

## Usage
## Create repo

```bash
$creates git repo
>git init

#add all file to the repo
>git add .

#commit all files to the repo with a comment
>git commit -m "first commit"

#connect git to the remote repo which is GitHub
>git remote add origin [Your git remote repo]

#push repo to the remote
>git push -u origin master

some updates are done from github ...
```
